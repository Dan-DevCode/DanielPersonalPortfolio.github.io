                <p>Project 1:
                    The goal of this project is to transform a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file into an ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) file that can be used with WEKA. It allows for compatibility with a range of machine learning tools and algorithms that support the WEKA format by converting the data from CSV to ARFF format. Using WEKA or other suitable tools, the produced dataset in ARFF format makes data analysis, visualization, and modelling easier. This enables the training and testing of machine learning models to create predictive models and data-driven applications. Effective data analysis and model building are made possible by this conversion process, which improves data preparation for machine learning activities.</p>

                <p>Project 2: 
                    This is a database schema, which provides an ordered picture of the data structures seen in database systems. Tables, columns, data types, and the relationships between various entities are all defined. Notably, tables with specific features and relationships to other tables are well defined, including those pertaining to books, authors, customers, orders, and shipping methods. The schema illustrates, for example, the relationship between writers and books and between clients and the orders they place. This schema is an essential tool for comprehending the architecture of the database, optimizing data management procedures, and facilitating effective data retrieval and analysis.</p>

                <p>Project 3:
                    The code given is intended to make it easier to convert data from the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format to the WEKA (Attribute-Relation File Format) format, which is frequently used for machine learning projects. This is accomplished by employing an ArffSaver object, which is in charge of managing the conversion procedure. The location of the ARFF file and the instances (data) to be saved are specified in the code. Lastly, the data transfer process is carried out by calling the writeBatch() method, which successfully saves the CSV data in the required ARFF format.</p>
